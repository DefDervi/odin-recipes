    <p>Taramosalata is a classic Greek appetizer made with fish roe, soaked bread, olive oil, and lemon juice. Satisfyingly delicious, this wonderful, slightly pink dip is perfect served on pita bread as part of a meze platter or a tasty lunch with some olives and a salad on the side.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>13 ounces bread, crust removed</li>
        <li>cold water to cover</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 large lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1 cup tarama (cured carp, cod, or mullet roe)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bread in a bowl, cover with water and let sit until the bread is well soaked, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain water from the bowl and squeeze all of the excess water from the bread.</li>
        <li>Combine bread, olive oil, onion, and lemon juice in a food processor; process until smooth. Add tarama and process until well combined.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>When finished blending ingredients, taste and adjust if necessary — add more lemon juice if too bitter, more tarama if you like a stronger flavor, or more olive oil if a richer texture is desired.</p>
    <p>For a modern twist on this classic recipe, I like to first caramelize the onions in some olive oil with a pinch of chili flakes before adding to the food processor.</p>
